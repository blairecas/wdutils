Read and write MS0511 HDD images data over RS-232
Data is NOT inverted for hddsender.exe (!)

HDD WD image format used in MS-0511
Data is inverted on HDD device (because of PDP-11 bus)

Block 0 (CHS 0:0:1)
-------------------
0x0000 (byte) sectors for track (e.g. 63)
0x0001 (byte) heads count (e.g. 16)
0x0002 (word) RT-11 partition 0 size in blocks (512-bytes)
0x0004 (word) RT-11 partition 1 size
..
0x0030 (word) RT-11 partition 23 size
.. (unknown)
0x0050 (word) 0x003x ascii code of last selected partition number (0..7)
0x0052 (word) number of 50Hz ticks to wait for user input at boot
0x0054 (word) 0x03E8 whats this? sort of magic number
.. (unknown)
0x01FC (word) chksumm negative summ of first 254 words 
0x01FE (word) chksumm high word of negative summ

Block 1 (CHS 0:0:2) .. 
----------------------
RT-11 partitions data (usual .dsk format)

Logical block 0 of .dsk can be WD bootloader code

HDD cartridge ROM will do next things on boot:
- test checksum on block 0 (will work with wrong checksum)
- wait some time (50Hz ticks on addr 0x0052 in block 0) allowing user 
  to select partition number for boot
  will not wait if only one partition
- load first block of that partition to CPU addr 0 and set CPU PC=0
- ...
- profit ^_^

Bootloader (first block of that partition) MUST be with zeroed data 
on addrs 010-0200??? (octal). So that code in bootloader is safe:
  .=0
  br 200
  .=200
  main bootloader code 
Addrs below 0200 (not sure about exact numbers) are used by WD PPU code 
to communicate with CPU and to send blocks of data CPU RAM <-> WD HDD
